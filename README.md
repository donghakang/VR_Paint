# Drawing Pad

This **Drawing Pad** is focused on 3D User Interface. Mainly this project is about implemented Diegetic Graphical Menu and
1-DOF Menu. This project is not about how well we copied the original software called 'Tilt Brush'.

## Summary:
Drawing Pad is a virtual painting experience similar to Google Tiltbrush.
The player starts with two controllers, one on each hand. On the right hand, you have a ball that you can use
to paint in 3D space. By pressing down on the Secondary Hand Trigger (button on the side), you start painting.
On the left controller, you have the settings for painting that we call "palette". You can interact with the
palette using the black laser pointer and the Secondary Index Trigger (button pressed with the index finger).
As for the palette, there are four sides. You can rotate the sides by pressing the Y button on the left
controller. The "Color" menu controls the color of the paint, "Size" menu controls the stroke width, "Texture"
changes the material that renders the stroke, and the "Emissive" controls whether emission should be added to
the material. All changes to the menu is reflected on the ball on the right hand to make it intuitive for
players. Finally, players can move around the environment using the right joystick with view-directed
steering and snap turn. As for advanced techniques, "Diegetic Graphical Menu" was implemented as shown in
the palette settings and "1-DOF Menu" was implemented as the sides within the palette.
